-SymbolTable Structure-
for this class I used a Hashmap to implement the table

-Sequence Structure-
I implemented the AVL tree provided by Weiss' code

-PriorityQueue Structure-
I used a node that contained T data and int priority to keep track of the pair given as parameter
then I used a Node<T> [] to hold all the nodes

-For reference sources I used Weiss' AVL tree class and priorityqueue class

-To implement the countNoSmallerThan method, I traversed through the tree using recursion and compared the data
v with each node's v and if it was greater than or equal to v I would return 1 keep traversing until it's a leave node.
